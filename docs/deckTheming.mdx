## Basic theming

CSS variables have been used for basic theming of content decks and their components.

Client-specifc CSS variables should be created to override the base styles as required.

When referencing what variables are available for override, see css > variables. This set of variables will eventually become part of a base content component library, and should be considered read-only.

## Custom styles

If more complex styling is required, a new React component + CSS module pair should be created to wrap the target base component.
